# Jukebox
Using Python 3.8 and its library, I have designed a Jukebox that plays music in real-time. The number of songs is limited, just as it is in a typical jukebox. You can pause, play and stop the music as per your wishes. The UI is designed using Tkinter and the music functionality works with the help of Pygames.
